Things, that should be good to make, but I postponed them or don't know how to do:

* refactor: make structure more closer to how react apps are written
* not sure: react-scripts should be ejected?
* write or use library with more resilent copy
* defaultProps: read about them and use
* rewrite application using redux
* read about context in react
* use library for interoperating with server (redux saga?)
* run application in docker
