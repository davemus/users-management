Timelog and results

* 3 hours for completing getting started tutorial, trying out ui library and choosing to stick with plain css and html to not invest time into learning additional library. Results of the work: styled table with stub users.
* 1 hour 40 minutes for initial setup of routing and small refactoring
* 1 hour for creation of UserForm and styling
* 40 minutes for making navigation via buttons and table rows
* 1 hour 20 minutes were spent on tries to make state work. I will take a long break now
